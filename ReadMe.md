  <h1>Astral</h1>
  <p>Astral is a machine learning AI for game automation. Astral recognizes and observes game objects in the same way as any other human would, using the Yolo algorithm, powerful GPUs, a trained model, and a screen as input.</p>

## üèóÔ∏è Dependencies
### üïµÔ∏è Installing Detector Dependencies
#### ‚ö° FastYolo
> Full instructions for installing required dependencies at https://github.com/maalik0786/FastYolo although different CUDA versions **should** work, tested with CUDA 11.0 and it worked.
#### üöÄ YoloV5
> The implementation of YoloV5 uses ML.NET, for GPU support follow the official instructions at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/how-to-guides/install-gpu-model-builder the implementation also works on CPU.
## üöÑ Speed
üî¨ A **GPU** is favored for faster predictions, while a CPU can still do predictions.

üåê If the input is through network, it is preferred that both computers be on the same lan network to avoid high latency; nevertheless, another machine on different network _(via the internet)_ may create latency and delays.

ü¶• The most playable delay for both input and predictions at the moment is **10 predictions per second** üîÆ or **100ms delay** (both input and predictions), which is not a big issue with newer GPUs and decent settings.

‚ö° Below is a list of graphics cards tested on resolutions and its prediction speed *(predictions/second)*.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Different factors can cause the GPU to perform better or worse; please take this table with a grain of salt and don't place too much faith in it; different hardware and environment can result in different results, such as having different video settings in a game, different drivers, or having background processes, for example.
